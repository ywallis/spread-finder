# spread-finder

This is a market scraping tool which searches for pairs that have a large spread, 
possibly allowing me to make that market.

## The criteria to search for are as follows:

- Spread eB > Spread eA
- Traded volume over X
- Futures exist as a hedge
- Pairs are fully tradeable

## TODO

- Include different kinds of scraping (B/A related)
- Includes hedging switch
- Include exchange switches
- Better error management
- Data persistence and backup
